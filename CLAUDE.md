- When I say ".send" please stage, commit, and push the repo updates to github
- when I say ".status=publish" please perform these steps:
1. look in each folder to find the highest vNNN file (the latest version) in that folder.  Only one per folder.
2. For each of those latest versions you find, update line 4 to "status: published".
3. For all of the other earlier file versions in those folders, update line 4 to "status: archived".
